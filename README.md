The implementations for the five candidate machine learning methods used to answer the question on predicting number of infections in Covid19 are seen in the following files;
* The implementation of BI-LSTM is shown in BI-LSTM hybrid model
* The implementation of LSTM-CNN is shown in LSTM-CNN 
* The implementation of LSTM is shown in LSTM model 38 weeks
* The implementation of GRU is shown in GRU model 38 weeks
* The implementation of SVR is shown in SVR model 38 weeks
* The paired t-test on each model is performed in the file master thesis paired t-test on COVID19
* The dataset used is called infection_per_sweden_on_covdi19
